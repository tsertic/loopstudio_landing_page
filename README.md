## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
- Site should recognize prefered color scheme from browser

### PageSpeed Insights Report

![](./speedtest.png)

Note:
Achieved a score of 95/100 in Best Practices because the aspect ratios of card images are 256px wide in their original form, whereas in the design, they are 254px wide (254 x 450, 0.56 - 256 x 450, 0.57). For this practice project, I didn't find it necessary to adjust the width of every image to achieve pixel-perfect aspect ratio alignment.
